<p className="about-paragraph">
  I spent of the first 10 years of my career journey as a Directory of
  Photography, but moved into the Development world in 2022. I love building
  beautiful solutions to complex problems and creating things that have never
  been seen before.
  <br />
  I'm inspired by automation or anything new and interesting. I aspire to build
  projects that are well used and loved. Also, eventually working on virtual
  cinematography projects.
